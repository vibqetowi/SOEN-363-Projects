“How you provide the link between the two data sources. Note that the data that you are collecting may not necessarily use same keys / identifiers.”

  One data source contains data about earthquakes only, while the other has information about multiple disaster types (tropical cyclone, earthquake, flood, volcano, drought). 
  To ensure consistency, only the common attributes for earthquakes from both data sources will be stored. Earthquakes will be implemented as a specific type of disaster in
  the database (see ERD), so it will be possible to store all disaster types with basic information.

  Every disaster comes with the time, type (tropical cyclone, earthquake, flood, volcano, drought), and location. 
  Earthquakes have additional information (depth in km, and magnitude). Disaster will be implemented as a weak entity, since a disaster must happen at a specific location. 
  The “id” attribute in the Disaster entity will be an internal integer primary key.
